/*
 * This kata serves as an introduction to the build system called Maven.
 * - install maven (jfgi)
 * - in the root folder of this project, run the command 'mvn clean install' (read: maven clean verify)
 *   on your command line.
 * If done correctly, this will display a message saying that the build failed because you have a test failure.
 * This is common practice. Your build is considered failing if it doesn't pass its tests, or if you have
 * compile errors in your code.
 *
 * Write fill out this class to make the tests pass. Do NOT edit the test.
